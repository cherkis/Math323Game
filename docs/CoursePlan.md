# Course Plan: Introduction to Proofs with Lean 4

An undergraduate course for mathematics students, taught using Lean 4 and Mathlib.
This version distinguishes between:

- material already covered in the lecture sequence from `Lectures/L01.lean` through `Lectures/L21.lean`, and
- later stages that are still planned for this class but have not yet been covered and whose lecture files are still to be written.

The original draft correctly anticipated the long-term direction of the course, but the actual delivery order developed somewhat differently. In particular, the course begins with Lean and type-theoretic foundations, places functions after relations and quotients, treats cardinality together with classical witness extraction in a single four-lecture block before analysis, and currently stops after the Archimedean property and density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$.

---

## Course Status

### Already covered

Stages 1 through 8 have corresponding lecture files and reflect the actual course progression.

### Still planned, not yet covered

Stages 9 through 11 remain part of the intended course plan, but they have not yet been taught. Those lectures are still to be written, so the descriptions below should be read as forward-looking rather than retrospective.

| 10 | Future | Planned | Sequences and limits |
| 11 | Future | Planned | Topology of the real line |

## High-Level Corrections to the Original Draft

- The course does not start directly with propositional logic. It starts with type theory, proof terms, Lean syntax, equality, and the distinction between term mode and tactic mode.
- Quantifiers appear as a short focused stage after the initial logic block, rather than as a long independent unit.
- Relations and quotient constructions are treated before the systematic unit on functions.
- Cardinality comes before the real-number and analysis material.
- `Classical.choose`, `noncomputable` definitions, and unique existence are folded into the four-lecture cardinality block rather than treated as a separate stage.
- Stages 9 through 11 still belong in the course plan, but they should be marked as planned continuation rather than as already matched by existing lectures.

### Key prerequisite edges

| From | To | Reason |
|------|----|--------|
| Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Quantifiers build on implication, negation, conjunction, and disjunction |
| Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Induction statements and arithmetic predicates are naturally quantified |
| Stage 2 | Stage 4 | Sets are treated as predicates, so quantified logic feeds directly into set reasoning |
| Stage 4 | Stage 5 | Relations are predicate-valued objects and subset/order examples come from set theory |
| Stage 5 | Stage 6 | Quotients motivate later function constructions and inverse-style arguments |
| Stage 4 | Stage 6 | Image and preimage are set-theoretic operations |
| Stage 6 | Stage 7 | Cardinality is expressed through injections, surjections, and bijections |
| Stage 3 | Stage 8 | The number-system ladder extends the arithmetic already developed on $\mathbb{N}$ |
| Stage 7 | Stage 8 | Density arguments are contrasted with countability and uncountability results, and the cardinality block also supplies the classical witness-extraction tools used in later constructions |
| Stage 8 | Stage 9 | Supremum and infimum continue the completeness material introduced for $\mathbb{R}$ |
| Stage 9 | Stage 10 | Sequence convergence theorems naturally depend on suprema and completeness |
| Stage 10 | Stage 11 | Topology on the real line is closely tied to limits, continuity, and sequential ideas |

## Stage 1 - Lean Foundations and Propositional Logic

### Actual lecture coverage: L01-L04

### Mathematical notions and terminology

- Type theory as the ambient language
- Propositions as types and proofs as terms
- Equality and reflexivity
- Implication, negation, conjunction, disjunction, and equivalence
- Term mode versus tactic mode
- True and False as propositions

### Lean tactics and tools introduced

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| `rfl` | Reflexivity and definitional equality |
| `#check`, `#eval`, `#print` | Basic inspection and experimentation |
| `intro` | Introduce hypotheses and bound variables |
| `exact` | Close a goal with an exact proof term |
| `apply` | Use a theorem or hypothesis whose conclusion matches the goal |
| `contradiction` | Close a goal from inconsistent hypotheses |
| `exfalso` | Change the goal to `False` |
| `dsimp` | Definitional simplification |
| `constructor` | Build conjunctions and equivalences componentwise |
| `left`, `right` | Choose a branch of a disjunction goal |
| `rintro` | Combined introduction and pattern matching |
| `obtain` | Extract data from conjunctions and disjunctions |

### Adjustment from the original plan

The opening stage is broader than plain propositional logic. It includes Lean syntax, type-theoretic foundations, and proof construction habits before the course settles into standard logical content.

---

## Stage 2 - Quantifiers and Predicates

### Actual lecture coverage: L05-L06

### Mathematical notions and terminology

- Universal and existential quantifiers
- Predicates on a domain
- Witnesses for existential statements
- Quantified arithmetic examples
- Even and odd as sample predicates

### Lean tactics and tools emphasized

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| `use` | Provide a witness for an existential goal |
| `obtain` | Extract a witness and its property from an existential hypothesis |
| `intro` | Handle universal quantifiers as functions |
| `linarith` | Solve linear arithmetic side goals arising in quantified statements |

### Adjustment from the original plan

Quantifiers occupy a shorter bridge stage than originally projected. They function mainly as preparation for induction, sets, and later formal definitions.

---

## Stage 3 - Induction and Arithmetic on Natural Numbers

### Actual lecture coverage: L07-L09

### Mathematical notions and terminology

- Induction on natural numbers
- Custom inductive types
- Recursive definitions
- Basic arithmetic identities
- Summation formulas
- Dependent types and theorem-library conventions

### Lean tactics and tools introduced or becoming standard

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| `cases` | Case split on inductive data |
| `induction'` | Structured induction on natural numbers and related data |
| `calc` | Present multi-step algebraic or arithmetic proofs cleanly |
| `congrArg` | Apply a function to both sides of an equality |
| `rw` | Rewrite using equalities |
| `ring` | Normalize ring expressions |
| `norm_num` | Prove concrete numerical statements |

### Adjustment from the original plan

This stage is still centered on natural numbers and induction, but the lectures also use it to teach proof organization for computational algebra and to preview dependent-type ideas.

---

## Stage 4 - Sets and the Logic-Set Dictionary

### Actual lecture coverage: L10-L11

### Mathematical notions and terminology

- Sets as predicates
- Membership, subset, union, intersection, complement
- Extensionality of sets
- Indexed unions and intersections
- Cartesian product and power set
- De Morgan laws for sets

### Lean tactics and tools introduced or emphasized

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| `ext` | Prove set equality by pointwise membership equivalence |
| `show` | Clarify the exact goal being proved |
| `change` | Replace the goal with a definitionally equal statement |
| `have` | Introduce useful intermediate claims |
| `suffices` | Replace a goal with a sufficient subgoal |
| `simp` | Reduce set-theoretic membership to logical formulas |
| `tauto` | Finish pure logical goals after set reduction |
| `push_neg` | Push negation through quantified and logical structure |

### Adjustment from the original plan

This stage closely matches the original intent, but the lectures make the logic-set correspondence more explicit and central than the original draft did.

---

## Stage 5 - Relations, Equivalence, and Quotients

### Actual lecture coverage: L12-L13

### Mathematical notions and terminology

- Binary relations and their basic properties
- Equivalence relations and congruence modulo $n$
- Partial orders, with subset as the main motivating example
- Quotient types and well-definedness
- Residue classes and modular arithmetic

### Lean tactics and tools introduced or emphasized

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| `unfold` | Expand definitions of relations and properties |
| `omega` | Solve linear arithmetic over naturals and integers |
| `Quotient.mk` | Construct quotient elements |
| `Quotient.sound` | Show equal quotient classes from the underlying relation |
| `Quotient.exact` | Recover the underlying relation from quotient equality |
| `Quotient.lift` | Define functions on quotient types |
| `Quotient.ind` | Prove properties by working with representatives |
| `congr` | Transport equalities through constructors and functions |

### Adjustment from the original plan

The original draft treated relations and quotients as separate consecutive stages. In the actual lectures they form one tightly connected block, with Lecture 13 moving directly from equivalence relations to quotient constructions.

---

## Stage 6 - Functions, Image/Preimage, and Inverses

### Actual lecture coverage: L14-L15

### Mathematical notions and terminology

- Injective, surjective, and bijective functions
- Composition and identity
- Range, image, and preimage
- Left and right inverses
- Axiom of choice in the form of selecting preimages

### Lean tactics and tools introduced or emphasized

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| `funext` | Prove equality of functions by pointwise equality |
| `choose` | Extract a choice function from a family of existential statements |
| `aesop` | Lightweight automation for routine goals |
| `exact?` | Search for a closing lemma in examples |

### Adjustment from the original plan

Functions appear later than in the original draft, after sets, relations, and quotients. This matches the lecture flow, where image and preimage rely on the prior set-theoretic infrastructure and inverse constructions build on existential reasoning.

---

## Stage 7 - Cardinality (4 Lectures)

### Actual lecture coverage: L16-L19

### Mathematical notions and terminology

- Equinumerous sets
- Countably infinite versus uncountable
- Explicit bijections such as $\mathbb{N} \leftrightarrow \mathbb{Z}$
- Cantor's diagonal argument
- Power-set growth
- Schroder-Bernstein theorem
- Cantor pairing function
- Turning existential proofs into explicit functions
- Choice as a term-forming principle
- Unique existence
- Chosen witnesses and their properties
- Larger-proof scaffolding using sections and local notation

### Lean tactics and tools introduced or emphasized

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| `native_decide` | Compute decidable examples directly |
| `refine` | Build structured proofs with placeholders |
| `by_contra` | Indirect reasoning in cardinality arguments |
| `nlinarith` | Nonlinear arithmetic in pairing-function proofs |
| `Classical.choose` | Extract a witness from an existential proof |
| `Classical.choose_spec` | Recover the property of the chosen witness |
| `noncomputable` | Mark definitions that use classical choice |
| `∃!` | Express and use unique existence |

### Adjustment from the original plan

The original draft already reserved four lectures for cardinality. In the actual course, that four-lecture block now includes both the countability material and the classical witness-extraction and unique-existence machinery that supports later construction-heavy mathematics.

---

## Stage 8 - Number Systems and First Real-Analysis Tools

### Actual lecture coverage: L20-L21

### Mathematical notions and terminology

- The number-system ladder $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$
- Semiring, ring, and field vocabulary
- Ordered fields and completeness as background properties of $\mathbb{R}$
- Absolute value and triangle-style estimates
- Archimedean property
- Floor function
- Density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$
- Density of irrationals in $\mathbb{R}$

### Lean tactics and tools introduced or emphasized

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| `field_simp` | Clear denominators in field expressions |
| `positivity` | Prove positivity and nonnegativity goals |
| `push_cast` | Normalize coercions across number systems |
| `exact_mod_cast` | Transfer equalities and inequalities across casts |
| `nlinarith` | Nonlinear inequalities over ordered fields |
| `gcongr` | Monotonicity-based inequality transport |
| `Int.floor` | Floor-function API |

### Adjustment from the original plan

The current course reaches the real numbers but has not yet entered the originally planned later stages on suprema, sequences, or topology. At present, the analysis block ends with Archimedean arguments, floor, density of rationals and irrationals, and a preview of ε-N reasoning. Interval notation (`Set.Ioo`, `Set.Icc`) moves to Stage 9 (Sup/Inf) where it is needed.

---

## Summary

The original plan remains useful as a view of the course's long arc, but it needed two corrections.

First, the covered material had to be reordered so that it matches the lecture files already written. Second, the later analysis and topology stages had to remain in the document while being labeled clearly as planned continuation rather than completed content.

With that adjustment, the plan now reflects both the actual course progression so far and the intended direction of the remaining part of the class.
